## Game On

As you may have noticed, my name is Emerson Paiva, today (23/06) I am turning 25 years old (congratulations to me🎉) and after a long time putting this project aside, I chose as a birthday present to kick off this project. blog (now goes).

## Why create this blog?

I believe it when they say that you learn a lot trying to help others, and since I started my journey as a developer, there in the internship, I already wanted to share a little bit of my career and what I've been learning, and I even made a post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@emersonpaiva/e-acabou-o-melhor-ano-da-minha-vida-at%C3%A9-agora-bb37811d6c89) after getting my first job as a developer, and I left some drafts lying there. Now I'm determined to make it happen!

I could keep using Medium or better yet, [dev.to](https://dev.to/), but what I'm looking for goes a little beyond sharing content and I want a 100% customizable platform where I am the almighty.

I had a bit of work, mainly in creating the layout, even if incomplete, but if you've made it this far, then it's been worth it 💜.

## My plans

I already have some notes in my [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and ideas to share here, in a few days we will have some posts related to **Front End** development and a lot of React.js.

My primary goal is to share tech content, but my plans are for more personal content (I promise to keep this in a separate section, so as not to distract from our focus here), such as recommendations for music, movies, etc., so don't be surprised if it runs out finding a quote to movies like [(500) Days of Summer](<https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/(500)_Days_of_Summer>) for example.

So pick a seat and let's embark on this journey with me. 🙂

Oh! All content here is [open source](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_aberto), so if you find something wrong, I'd love to receive your pull request on [github](https://github.com/oemersonpaiva/emersonpaiva.dev) 💜.

Thanks!!!
